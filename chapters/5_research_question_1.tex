\chapter{Qualitative clustering approach}
\label{ch:reserach_question1}
The following sections describe the white box approach for clustering mutants.
We perform a qualitative analysis on mutants to identify characteristics. 
These characteristics represent the mutants.
With the mutants represented we devise a methodology for clustering mutants.
Our goal is to cluster every mutant that is generated while maintaining effectiveness.
