The following sections describe the white box approach for clustering mutants.
We perform a qualitative analysis on the mutants to identify characteristics. 
These characteristics represent the mutants.
With the mutants represented we devise a methodology for clustering these mutants.
Our goal is to cluster every mutant that is generated while main tainting effectiveness.
