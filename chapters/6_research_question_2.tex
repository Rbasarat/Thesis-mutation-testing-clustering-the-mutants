\chapter{Quantitative clustering approach}
\label{ch:reserach_question2}
In the following sections we devise a black box approach for clustering mutants.
We make use of the characteristics identified in Chapter \ref{ch:identifying_characteristics}.
While our goal remains the same as in Chapter \ref{ch:reserach_question1}, the method to achieve it is different.
\newline
We start by selecting a machine learning algorithm.
Next we select a training strategy and an implementation.
Last we select the parameters required by the algorithm.
