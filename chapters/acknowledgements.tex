\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I would like to thank my supervisor, dr. Ana Oprescu, for her guidance ever since my first semester on the University of Amsterdam.
Thank you Ana, for being my supervisor throughout this thesis and being so involved with your students.
I would also like to thank my company supervisor Thomas Biesaart for all the standups, rubber ducking and sharing my enthusiasm throughout this thesis.
I would like to thank Infi for providing me the opportunity to do this research (and doing it full time).
And finally, my deepest thanks go out to my dearest, Maja Bloemraad.
Thank you for standing by me and believing in me throughout this whole master study.
